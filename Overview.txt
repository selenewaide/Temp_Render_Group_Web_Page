Objective - Web Application

1. data collection through API
	-Weather data
		-get and API key
		-python script with requests
			look at json file and write code to get it
			save file with name as date & time
			file format json
			get only what we need, in json
		-schedule task python for every 5 mins

	-Dublin bikes data
		-get and API key
		-python script with requests
			look at json file and write code to get it
			save file with name as date & time
			file format json
			get only what we need, in json
		-schedule task python for every 5 mins
 2. data management/storage in DB on AWS 
	-Look at Library boto - python interface to all AWS
	-get a DB on AWS
	-(this can be a later task, for development save files in persistent EC2 - I have this)

3. display bike stations on map
	-Google map & API key for it
	-HTML page 
	-javascript to insert items into map
		- colours / big and small circles etc
 4. occupancy information
	-our json file we downloaded living in EC2
 5. weather information 
	-our json file we downloaded living in EC2

6. interactivity (click, API request, handle response) 
	-javascript on the website, similar to weather project S1

7. project served on EC2
	-get a free EC2 instance for the team
 8. Github repo 
	-team repo

Bare minimum for prototype:
	-webpage mock up with a Google map and some graphs
	-sample mock data file for bike info - we have been given this…
	-sample mock data file for weather info - we have been given this…
	-basic javascript to read these files and display in web page
	-webserver - flask 
		-run flask
		-connect web browser to flask
		-then flask provides the web page to run	


Time sensitive issues:
	- one week of data required
	- prototype ready by certain timeline 


Backlog: AGREE ON EXPECTED OUTCOMES FOR EACH OF THESE!!!
	- mock web page as above
	- get some API bike data and look at json so that we can write the python script for it
		- javascript to read this info
	- get some API weather data and look at json so that we can write the python script for it
		- javascript to read this info
	- flask - find out how we use flask and run one of our web projects on flask
